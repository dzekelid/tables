  description: Merchants can create custom Order Types via "/v3/merchants/{mId}/order_types".
    It is useful to associate these custom order types with particular system order
    types in order to group things functionally. For example, a merchant may have
    a "Lunch Take-Out" order type and a "Dinner Take-Out" order type. These two order
    types can be associated with the "TAKE-OUT-TYPE" system order type so that applications
    can understand that they are both take-out order types.
